    "\n",
    "Notebooks can be described as 'executable documents' where code and documentation are colocated within the same dynamic environment. This format combines rich presentation and documentation with working executable code. A notebook is essentially a 'one stop shop' for creating working software that is intended to be shared with your peers or with a broad audience.\n",

    "### Why should I use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks provide you with the ability to write code interactively and perform an analysis.  They also are extremely portable as they can be exported individually as code or as HTML pages.  This enables the easy transfer of knowledge between parties.  Notebooks use a language similar to HTML called Markdown to create HTML presentations.  Some example Markdown code can be seen below:\n",
